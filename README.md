# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This project is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This implementation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing game experience.
